# Arduino-Based RFID Door Lock System

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates a comprehensive Arduino-based RFID door lock system designed for secure access control. Utilizing the MFRC522 RFID reader module, a servo motor for door mechanism control, and both LEDs and a buzzer for user feedback, this system ensures reliable and convenient access management.

**Features:**
- **RFID Authentication:** The system reads RFID card UIDs and verifies them against a predefined list of authorized IDs.
- **Servo Motor Control:** The servo motor manipulates the physical locking mechanism of the door, allowing it to lock or unlock based on access authorization.
- **Visual and Audible Feedback:** LEDs and a buzzer provide clear visual and audible indicators of access status, improving user experience.
- **Modular and Customizable:** The code and hardware setup can be easily modified or expanded to include additional features such as keypads or biometric sensors.

**Components Used:**
- **Arduino Board:** Acts as the central control unit for processing data and managing components.
- **MFRC522 RFID Reader Module:** Reads RFID card information and provides UID for access verification.
- **Servo Motor:** Controls the locking mechanism, rotating between locked and unlocked positions.
- **LEDs:** Visual indicators for access status (green for access granted, red for access denied).
- **Buzzer:** Emits audible signals to complement visual feedback.

**Setup Instructions:**
1. **Gather Components:**
   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
   - MFRC522 RFID reader module
   - Servo motor
   - LEDs and resistors
   - Passive buzzer
   - Jumper wires

2. **Wiring Connections:**
   - Connect the RFID module to the Arduino (SS, RST, SDA, SCK, MOSI, MISO pins).
   - Connect the servo motor to the Arduino.
   - Wire the LEDs and buzzer to their respective pins on the Arduino.

3. **Code Deployment:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Copy and paste the provided code into a new sketch.
   - Verify and upload the code to the Arduino board.

4. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set baud rate to 9600).
   - Observe the system's response to RFID card detection and access attempts.

**Documentation:**
The repository includes detailed documentation on system design, algorithm, and code explanation, as well as step-by-step setup and testing instructions. 

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integration of additional authentication methods (e.g., keypads, biometrics).
- Remote access control features via mobile applications or IoT connectivity.
- Improved security protocols and user management systems.

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding and implementing RFID-based access control systems using Arduino, with opportunities for further development and customization.
